# Project Summary

This tool was built to make qualitative research easier for analysts and students who work with large text-based data. It applies natural language processing to identify key themes, summarize recurring ideas, and classify sentiment.

The workflow covers data extraction, cleaning, theme clustering, and visualization. It works for data from PDFs, text documents, or scraped web content.

By automating repetitive parts of thematic analysis, this tool saves time and allows researchers to focus on interpretation rather than data sorting.
